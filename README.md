# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Project

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

### This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1. Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
2. Load the activity and featured info
3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
7. From the data set in step 6, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
